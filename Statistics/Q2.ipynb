    "Q-2. Consider a dataset containing the heights (in centimeters) of 1000 individuals. The mean height is 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. The dataset is approximately normally distributed, and its skewness is approximately zero. Based on this information, answer the following questions:\n",

    "a. What percentage of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm?\n",
