    "Q-4. A group of 20 friends decide to play a game in which they each write a number between 1 and 20 on a slip of paper and put it into a hat. They then draw one slip of paper at random. What is the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square (i.e., 1, 4, 9, or 16)?"

    "Answer:)- There are 4 perfect squares between 1 and 20, namely 1, 4, 9, and 16. There are a total of 20 numbers in the hat.\n",

    "P(event) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes\n",

    "P(perfect square) = 4 / 20 = 1/5\n",

    "Therefore, the probability that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square is 4/20 = 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there is a 20% chance that the number on the slip of paper is a perfect square."
